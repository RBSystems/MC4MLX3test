# MC4MLX3test
Example Project of using MC4 to talk to MLX3 and send signals to a remote procesor
It is just an MC4, using the internal EX/ER gateway for an MLX3 remote, and sending the button presses out 
via a 3-series EISC to another processor.  The simplest possible example of a program with a remote and an EISC.

SIMPL#Pro, done with JetBrains Rider under MacOS.
